<p>In Temasek Primary, the school has a set of Temasek Staff core values
(Open-Mindedness, Responsibility, Collaboration, Honesty, Innovation, Dedication),
manifested by the acronym ‘ORCHID’. If you know of a Temasek Staff who
upholds, through his/her actions and words, any of the Temasek Staff values,
we would like to invite you to pen your words of appreciation to the Temasek
Staff.
<br>
<br>Your words of appreciation will serve as an encouragement, motivation
and positive affirmation of the good work of the Temasek Staff.
<br>
<br>Showing your appreciation, gratitude or even saying thank you is really
easy and anyone can do it, whether you’re a pupil, a parent, an ex-pupil,
an Alumni member of the school, someone who had the opportunity to work
with any of the Temasek Staff or even a colleague of the Temasek staff!
