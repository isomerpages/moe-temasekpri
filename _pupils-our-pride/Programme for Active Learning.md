### Programme for Active Learning (PAL)

**PAL Coordinator:** Mr Syed Ali Omar

**PAL @ Temasek Primary** <br> <img src="/images/pal1.png" style="width:230px;height:220px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> We are delighted to inform you that the school had embarked on PAL for our P1 and P2 pupils since 2016. PAL is an initiative by the Ministry of Education (MOE) aimed at providing greater balance between the learning of knowledge and the development of skills and values to better prepare our pupils to thrive in a fast-changing and globalised future. PAL at Temasek Primary is part of the curriculum and will be carried out during time-tabled time.

**“My Little Adventure around the World”**  <br>Temasek’s PAL programme, “My Little Adventure Around the World”, aims to develop the character of our pupils by bringing them on an adventure around the world where they would be able to explore a wide variety of activities which are experiential in nature and incorporate elements of fun and enjoyment. Pupils also learn socio-emotional competencies such as respecting others and responsible decision making. 

Pupils will be exposed to different modular activities in 4 broad areas of Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. The school will be implementing 3 PAL modules for each level as shown in the table below.
