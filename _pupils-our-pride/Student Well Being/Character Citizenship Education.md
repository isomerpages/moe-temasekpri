#### CCE Curriculum and Programmes

###### Nurturing resilient Temasekians through providing an enabling environment that cares, connects, builds character and celebrates effort.

The school’s Student Well-being Framework (2015) was refined in 2021. It reinforces how the school segments student needs and expectations in the 6 broad areas (domains) of Cognitive, Social, Emotional, Physical, Aesthetics and Psychosocial Environment. Its vision seeks to develop every Temasekian into a future ready citizen, rooted in values through the use of the 4Cs approach of CARE, CONNECT, CHARACTER & CELEBRATE.

##### School-based CCE Curriculum: Temasek Leaders for Life 

The Leader for Life (LFL) programme, one of Temasek Primary’s signature programmes, encompasses the exploration of values as well as Dr Stephen Covey’s 7 HABITS to strengthen our students’ personal and interpersonal effectiveness. The curriculum seeks to build character, to convict their contributions to others and to widen their impact within and beyond school.

The school’s Leader for Life (LFL) curriculum provides opportunities to build students’ character through deepening the learning of 7 Habits, School Values and SEL. 

Students are also given various opportunities to demonstrate their values in action through the school’s Kindness and Gratitude projects that lead up to the celebration of Support Staff Appreciation and Service Learning projects where students are empowered to choose an area in which they would like to contribute back to society.

**Co-Curriculum Framework (Updated 2019)**

1\. In tandem with the school’s vision and mission, the school’s approach to its co-curriculum aims to complement the curriculum to provide a holistic development of our students. Taking into cognizance the ‘Learn for Life’ movement, school strategic thrusts and student outcomes, the co-curriculum framework was reviewed and refined in 2019 to include an additional domain, i.e. Enrichment and Lifeskills (ENL). 

2\.  The Enrichment and Lifeskills (ENL) Programme complements the other co-curricular programmes to expose students to different experiences that broaden their horizons. Considering the students' needs and abilities, the enrichments are designed and customised to cover five broad areas, i.e. Citizenship, Self-Management and Social Skills, Physical Activities and Sports, Aesthetics and Enterprise.

The Citizenship enrichment programme in the school aims to develop students' civic literacy, cross-cultural skills and global perspectives. These enrichments include the NE/SS Learning Journeys and the Festive Outreach activities to provide students with opportunities to have broader experiences and understand other cultures better. The Festive Outreach programme provides opportunities for our Temasekians to connect with the community. This programme is led by the student leaders with the guidance of the teacher-in-charge. Temasekians present a festive token to nearby residents at their homes. After the event, the teacher-in-charge facilitates a reflection session where Temasekians reflect on their learning and experiences.

Other Values in Action programs that promote these objectives are as follows: 

 Values in Action:  
1\) Service Learning:
<br>a. Values in Action plays a crucial part in the realisation of the school’s Servant Leader student outcome. To promote servant leadership, joy of learning and the importance of social responsibility, students are involved in meaningful Service Learning Projects that meet the needs of the community.

As a Service Learning project, in 2020, in the project themed “Our Singapore”, upper primary students learnt about migrant workers in Singapore and prepared care pack packages for these groups.  In 2021, in the project themed “Family3”, students learnt about the importance of family and how they can show their appreciation towards their family members. The students designed a photo frame and presented this together with a thank you note to a chosen family member, to express their gratitude for shaping them to be who they are today.

**2\) Support Staff Appreciation**
<br>**As part of Support Staff Appreciation Day, the students learn about the roles of the different support staff and express their gratitude to them in various ways, for example, through songs, cards and artworks.** 

The school also involves staff and students in the yearly Kindness and Gratitude Project, where students prepare tokens of appreciation for the school's support staff which are gifted to the support staff at the Support Staff Appreciation Day. As part of Support Staff Appreciation Day, the students learnt more about the respective roles of the different support staff and express their gratitude with songs, dance videos, cards, art canvases and decorated the canteen with words of affirmation. On Support Staff Appreciation Day, some KP take on the duties of the Support Staff so that Support Staff can enjoy their lunch treat with no disruption to school operations.
