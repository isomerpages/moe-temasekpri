<h2><strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</strong></h2>
<p>At Temasek Primary School, we design and implement CCE programmes and
learning experiences that engage students both cognitively and affectively.
These experiences enable students to apply the values and social-emotional
skills taught in CCE lessons and develop the 21st Century Competencies
(21CC) necessary for their future.</p>
<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong></h4>
<p>The school leverages Safer Internet Day, a global campaign promoting the
responsible use of online platforms and mobile devices, to keep our community
informed of current cyber wellness trends and threats. This reinforces
cyber wellness messages taught during CCE lessons.</p>
<p>Through this programme, students develop the 21CC of Civic Literacy, Global
Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills. By participating in a global campaign
and learning about responsible online behaviour, they become more aware
of their digital footprint, develop civic consciousness in the digital
community, and stay informed on worldwide digital citizenship practices.</p>
