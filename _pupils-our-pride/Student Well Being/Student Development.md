The Student Development Team seeks to provide a safe, respectful and disciplined learning environment for students where they have opportunities to engage in quality learning experience and acquire values supportive of their lifelong well-being. Our objective is to build a culture of care which is conducive for the holistic development of our students.

**Temasek Starts Right**
<br>As a new School year begins, teacher and students renew relationships after the holidays, see new faces and establish expectations, rules, and routine for the year. The activity planned during Temasek Starts Right engages teachers and student in getting to know each other, and discussing the values and habits that will shape their classroom community.  

  

**Buddy System**
<br>At the beginning of each year, our P2 students act as buddies to welcome the P1 students into the Temasek Family. They assists the P1 in the purchase of food during recess and help to  ease them into formal school setting.

  

**Counselling Support**
<Br>We support our students not only in their academic pursuits but also on their journey of growth as young adolescents. We have  2 full-time counsellor and a part-time counsellors whom the students can approach when faced with problems or concerns.

Our counselling programme via 2-Tier intervention support aims to help our students manage and cope with social-emotional challenges and empower them for success.

**Learning and Behavioural Support**
<br>For students with special learning needs, our special needs officers provide scheduled withdrawal support to help our students cope with their learning.

  

We **C**onnect with our students …

  

**Dialogue with Year Heads**
<br>Year Heads conducts dialogue session with student representative and they are invited to bring up concerns and suggestions on school improvement, student welfare, school programmes and activities.  
  

**“Your Voice Matters”**
<br>Our students are welcomed to provide ideas, suggestions as well as feedback on school improvement, student welfare, school programmes and activities. We value students’ responses and they are reviewed regularly.

  

**1 to 1 Teacher- Student Interaction**
<br>The 1 to 1 Teacher-Student Interaction Time ensures more attention is given to individual student development throughout school life. The 1 to 1 teacher-student interaction time provides protected time for teachers to have quality interactions with their students so as to build strong and healthy relationship between form teachers and their pupils.

  

It allows teachers to acquire knowledge and understanding of each students so as to facilitate better feedback and support to meet each student’s developmental needs. It also serves as a platform for students to share with their teachers any concerns or sensitive issues that they may have.

  

We build the **C**haracter of our students …

  

**ACORNS**
<br>Like the majestic oak tree that grows from a tiny acorn, the school believes that all Temasekians given time and patience, can learn, act responsibly and care for others. They have the potential to be nurtured into responsible citizens with proper guidance to help them grow in strength in character.

  

**ACORNS** is a structured process for addressing discipline and behavourial issues. It is value-based and underpinned by Stephen’s Covey’s timeless principles of 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and elements of Restorative Practice.

  

**ACORNS** aims to develop:

*   students’ individual responsibility and shared accountability;
*   students’ emphatic understanding for others’ experiences;
*   students’ understanding of the impact of one’s own behaviour on others;
*   students’ problem solving capabilities by encouraging those involved in the problem to find their own solutions;   
<br><br> and promote:

*   application of School Values in correcting one’s behaviour;
*   restoration of students’ sense of belonging to a community (e.g. class, peer group or school).

**ACORNS** involves a 6-step process which is designed to enable offending students to follow an Awareness-Restoration-Growth sequence. At each step, probing questions are used to guide students towards problem resolution and restoration of relationship between teachers and students and/or students and peers.
