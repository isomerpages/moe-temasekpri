### Cyber Wellness

##### New Media Literacies

New Media Literacies are defined as the competencies to create, connect and curate information in the digital networked environment. Acquiring competency in these will enable students to develop an understanding of the social practices governing the Web and be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate and participate productively.

**Cyber Wellness**
<br>Cyber Wellness (CW) in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.

**3 principles of Cyber Wellness**
<br>The school ‘s approach to the Cyber Wellness curriculum is guided by the MOE’s cyber wellness principles.

These 3 main principles will guide your child's decision-making and anchor their well-being:

*   Respect for self and others.
*   Safe and responsible use.
*   Positive peer influence

At Temasek Primary School, we engage students in acquiring New Media Literacies through Digital Literacy lessons and Cyber Wellness lessons. Lessons are mainly carried out during the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP).In addition to cyber wellness lessons, student leaders also known as Cyber Wellness Ambassadors are supported with platforms for learning and sharing. Student leaders undergo training and are tasked to reach out to their peers on cyber wellness topics such as ‘Oversharing’ and ‘Fake News’.
