<h3>Cyber Wellness</h3>
<h5>New Media Literacies</h5>
<p>New Media Literacies are defined as the competencies to create, connect
and curate information in the digital networked environment. Acquiring
competency in these will enable students to develop an understanding of
the social practices governing the Web and be equipped with the knowledge
and skills to navigate and participate productively.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>
<br>Cyber Wellness (CW) in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses
on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum
aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power
of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace
and be safe and responsible users of ICT.</p>
<p><strong>3 principles of Cyber Wellness</strong>
<br>The school ‘s approach to the Cyber Wellness curriculum is guided by the
MOE’s cyber wellness principles.</p>
<p>These 3 main principles will guide your child's decision-making and anchor
their well-being:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Respect for self and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safe and responsible use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positive peer influence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At Temasek Primary School, we engage students in acquiring New Media Literacies
through Digital Literacy lessons and Cyber Wellness lessons. Lessons are
mainly carried out during the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP).In addition
to cyber wellness lessons, student leaders also known as Cyber Wellness
Ambassadors are supported with platforms for learning and sharing. Student
leaders undergo training and are tasked to reach out to their peers on
cyber wellness topics such as ‘Oversharing’ and ‘Fake News’.</p>
