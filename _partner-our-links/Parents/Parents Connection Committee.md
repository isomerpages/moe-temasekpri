### Parent Connection Committee (PCC)

The Parent Connection Committee (PCC) was set up in Temasek Primary School in 1999. The school strongly believes that the students’ overall quality of education would be enhanced with the involvement of parents in their children’s education. The PCC complements the school by supporting and strengthening the school’s programme to improve children’s well-being and enrich their learning. The PCC also provides valuable feedback or ideas to the school on school operations, practices and programmes that will benefit the school environment.
