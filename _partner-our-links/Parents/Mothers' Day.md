### Mothers' Day

The Parent Connection Committee (PCC) was proactive in planning and organising the sale of the beautifully packaged carnations. The focus of the project was to spread love, gratitude and appreciation of our students towards their mothers. The PCC dedicated their time and effort to purchase the carnations, as well as other materials. They also demonstrated their talents in packaging the carnations beautifully. Many of our students demonstrated their enthusiasm and support through their purchase of the carnations. There were some who even presented the carnations to our female teachers!
