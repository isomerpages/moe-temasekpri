### Temasek Magicland

Our PCC Team and Parent Volunteers were actively involved in the setting up of FoodLand and managing various stalls. They also volunteered to oversee the selling of plants and organised interesting activities for the pupils and their parents as part of the fundraising drive. In addition, many parents also donated food items obtained from licensed sources from the various racial/ethnic groups in Singapore. We are grateful to our partners who supported and assisted us to ensure to success of Temasek MagicLand!
