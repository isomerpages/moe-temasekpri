### Primary 1 to Primary 3 Lifeskills Programme

The active involvement of the school partners is important in contributing towards the all-rounded development of Temasekians in building their character and equipping them with a life-long learning mindset. This is achieved via the Lifeskills Programme for our P1 to P3 students by the Parent Connection Committee. The curriculum imparts practical life skills and knowledge to our students, where they are inculcated with a sense of independence and ownership towards self-management and self-care.
