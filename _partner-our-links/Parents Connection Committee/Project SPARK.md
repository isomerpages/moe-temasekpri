### Project SPARK

**Project SPARK (School Partners Are Reinforcing Kindness)**

In this project, the Parent Volunteers (PVs) act as character coaches in championing kindness. They co-partner the school in its efforts to inculcate and promote the value of kindness and graciousness. Twice a month, the PVs meet up to discuss and prepare the materials to conduct the programme. They create exciting activities inspired by Steven Coveyâ€™s 7 Habits, which also involve the element of kindness. Every last Wednesday of the month, the PVs come together to run the programme for all Primary 1 to 6 pupils during their respective recesses. Check out some photos of them in action!
