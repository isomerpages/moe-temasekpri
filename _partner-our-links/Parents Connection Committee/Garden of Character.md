### Garden Of Character

In collaboration with the Parent Connection Committee (PCC), the lower primary students were given the opportunity to work together to grow and care for their mini class garden. Through the guidance of the dedicated PCC, students were engaged in meaningful learning activities. They acquired basic planting and gardening skills as well as developed a green awareness and respect for the environment. Students demonstrated responsibility when they nurtured their flowering plants by taking turns to water the plants and monitoring their growth.
