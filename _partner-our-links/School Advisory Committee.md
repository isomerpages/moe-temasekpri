### School Advisory Committee

The School Advisory Committee (SAC) has played an active role in promoting excellence in the school. It has instituted the SAC Academic and Non-Academic Awards since 1999. These awards are presented to pupils who have performed well in the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and excelled in sports and aesthetics at the national levels.

  

The SAC also recognizes the contributions of staff by presenting the SAC Long Service Award for both professional and administrative staff at the annual Speech and Prize-Giving Day.

  

To promote innovation and enterprise among staff and pupils, the SAC institutes the Temasek Innovation Award (TIA) from 2005. This award was given to staff and pupils who have come up with innovative programmes or products that have produced significant impact at the school or national level.
