#### Taiwan School Immersion since 2017

Starting 2017, the school partnered Jian Kang Elementary School in Taiwan to enrich the cultural learning experience of our students. Temasek Primary students host students of Jian Kang Elementary School where they show the students the Temasek and Singapore culture and educational experience. Due to COVID-19 in 2020, this could not take place. To maintain the experience, a pen-pal programme with Jian Kang Elementary School was initiated in 2021.
