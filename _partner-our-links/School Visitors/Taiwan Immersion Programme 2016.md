Taiwan Immersion Programme   

From 21-22 July 2016, a group of pupils and teachers from National University of Tainan Affliated Primary School came to Temasek Primary for a 2-day immersion programme. They were accompanied by their principal and 6 other teachers.  The pupils, aged between 10 and 12 years old, were attached to the P4 and P5 levels. Each pupil was assigned a Temasek buddy and all of them had a fun-filled 2-day Temasek experience in class. Not only did the Taiwanese students attend our Racial Harmony commemorative event in the hall, they also performed a Taiwanese tribal dance as an introductory item upon their arrival.  On the second day, a customised Robotics lessons was conducted by our ICT HOD, Mdm Marlini, for the Taiwanese pupils and teachers. They enjoyed the lessons tremendously and were envious that we had the expertise and infrastructure to allow every child in Temasek to experience Robotics lessons.
