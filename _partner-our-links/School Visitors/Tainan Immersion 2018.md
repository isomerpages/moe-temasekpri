### Tainan Immersion 2018

On 16 and 17 July 2018, Temasek Primary School welcomed a group of 34 primary 4-6 Taiwanese pupils from University of Tainan Elementary School at 7.30am. They performed 3 wonderful recorder pieces and all of them together with their Principal Mr Xu Zhi Ting and 4 other teachers were warmly received by our school leaders and HODs.

  

The students also had fun filled activities with their buddies during their CCA timings and many of them enjoyed our canteen food. Although it was only a short 2 day span of immersion, both TMPS and Taiwan buddies had established friendship which left them with fond memories of the immersion days.

  

The Taiwanese pupils also attended robotic lessons for their visit and they had lots of fun with their buddies during their stay. During the farewell session on the last day, they had a gift exchange and photo taking session whereby international friendships were established and forged. Their principal, Mr Xu were extremely touched and heartened by the warm and sincere hosting and promised to return the same kindness should our pupils have a chance to visit their school.
