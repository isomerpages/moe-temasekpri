### Visitors from Malawi 2016

Our school also hosted visitors from Malawi on 21 July 2016. They performed martial arts during our Racial Harmony Day concert and also conducted a lesson on Chinese poem appreciation and writing for our P5 HCL pupils. During the lesson, they interacted with our pupils and shared with them their experiences in learning Chinese.
