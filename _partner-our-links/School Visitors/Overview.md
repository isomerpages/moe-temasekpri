### School Visitors

With our established reputation, Temasek Primary School has been receiving immersion requests over the years. To date, we had build and sustain relationships with some schools from Taiwan and Japan. We strongly believed that these immersion programs not only provide valuable opportunities for our students to form international friendships, it is also a good platform for them to embrace diversity and culture of other nations.
