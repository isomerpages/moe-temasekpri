### P3 Singapore Japanese School Exchange Programme 2016

160 of our Primary Three pupils hosted an equal number of Primary Three pupils from the Singapore Japanese School (Changi Campus) during their visit to Temasek Primary on Tuesday, 12 July 2016. Both pupils from Temasek Primary and the Singapore Japanese School wrote introduction cards and had a chance to meaningfully interact through playing our traditional games of five stones, kuti-kuti, pick-up sticks and chopstick marbles. These games were facilitated by the P6 NE Ambassadors and pupils from Primary 4B. The P3 pupils then collaborated in the mass Art activity which featured the various traditional costumes of the various races.

  

On Friday, 22 July 2016, the P3 pupils from Primary 3B, 3C, 3D and 3E visited the Singapore Japanese School and had the chance to learn more about the Japanese culture through their interaction with the Japanese pupils when they played various games like “the string game” and paper spinning tops, as well as in the making of “origami”.

This positive interaction between the two schools is clearly captured in the following photographs:
