### Safety of Students in school

For the safety of our students, no unauthorised person will be allowed into the school building at any time.

**Visits to Classrooms**<br>
For security reasons, no visitor will be allowed to go to the classrooms without the permission of the Principal, Vice-Principal or Heads of Department. All visitors are to report to the General Office first.
