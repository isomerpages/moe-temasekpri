### Our Corporate Logos

<img src="/images/corplogo1.png" style="width:260px;height:200px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> The Temasek Heart is an orchid that has been uniquely hybridized and cultivated by our own pupils and teachers in 2010. Its intense purple centre signifies our passion for learning in the school and its purple fringed petals the positive impact of the learning on our lives and others.  
  

Just as Singapore is famed for its research programmes in orchids, the Temasek Heart represents our innovative spirit as a school. It is also a symbol of the values that our staff hold close to – **O**pen mindedness, **R**esponsibility, **C**ollaboration, **H**onesty, **I**nnovation and **D**edication. Its creation is a testimony to our focus to produce graduates from the school who will be future-ready citizens rooted in values. The Temasek Heart is a reminder that learning is always to be treasured and applied from the heart.

It is well known for its impressive flowering display, where the entire tree is spectacularly covered in blossoms.  
  
  

The Tabebuia Rosea is a tree that has been with Temasek Primary since our humble beginning, providing shade and beauty to generations of our pupils and staff. Over the years, it has become a symbol of the Vibrant Learning Campus that we strive to be. Its flowers trumpet our growth as a school in nurturing and enriching lives which have passed through our portals. The Tabebuia Rosea is a reminder that service is not only an opportunity for us to give to others but also to grow ourselves.
