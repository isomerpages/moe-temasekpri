### School Rules & Regulations 

#### Discipline Philosophy

The purpose of school rules and regulations is to provide a safe and positive learning environment for our teachers and students. Students learn well when there is order and discipline. 

Discipline is an educative process and the goal is to instil self-discipline and good character in students. The focus is on promoting positive student behaviour in support of learning and growth through the teaching of values and skills and timely reinforcement through corrective guidance to address students’ misbehaviour. 

Disciplinary measures serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made. It is to be meted fairly, firmly and appropriately. School and parents/guardians need to collaborate to help our students understand that their actions carry consequences and they must learn to take responsibility for their action.  To sustain positive behaviour in school and at home, school and family need to collaborate, communicate and enforce the same expectation.

The school adopts the following **ABC** approach in instilling self-discipline and good character in students.
