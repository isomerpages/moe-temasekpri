<p>As we go into 2026, on behalf of the school, I would like to thank parents,
guardians and all caregivers in the Temasek community for your trust in
and support for the school over the years. It is not something we take
for granted and we are very grateful for your encouragement and partnership.</p>
<p>The year started well with our “Temasek Starts Right” programme which
aims to build a strong classroom culture right from the start of the year.
This year, we are placing greater emphasis on the teaching of executive
functioning skills to help our students manage themselves, their emotions
and their relationships better.</p>
<p>We have also introduced Steven Covey’s 8th Habit, Finding your Voice and
Inspiring Others to Find Theirs, to complement the current 7 Habits that
our students are familiar with. Many of our Temasekians are talented in
various ways and we hope that this habit will encourage them to discover
their gifts, inner strengths and purpose, to contribute to others, in big
and small ways.</p>
<p>In preparing our students to be future-ready citizens, we have been discussing
current affairs with them at school and class levels. We are happy to note
that our students generally are aware of the events of significance happening
around them and more importantly, they show interest in these happenings.
It is important that our students keep up with relevant current local and
global affairs to be in a better position to make good and responsible
decisions in the future, with a deeper and more comprehensive understanding
of issues and how they have evolved over the years. This year, we are starting
level-wide discussions on current affairs in the new Current Affairs Discussion
(CAD) Room in the canteen where we hope to hear our students’ thoughts
on trending issues. The discussions will now be in Mother Tongue Languages
as well.</p>
<p>Another area of importance this year will be ensuring the safe, respectful
and meaningful use of AI. In equipping our students for a world transformed
by AI, we will teach students about AI, how to use AI and how to learn
with AI. We will engage our students in discussions on AI as part of our
Current Affairs Moments programme to help our children see the exciting
possibilities that AI brings but also the possible dangers to look out
for and how to help others navigate the new world with AI safely.</p>
<p>To all our stakeholders, we will make it a great 2026 together. Your continued
support is greatly appreciated. We hope to take our students through incredible
learning and growth experiences and on meaningful learning journeys in
the year.</p>
<p>Here’s to an incredible 2026 –&nbsp;<em>Forward Together, Temasek</em>!</p>
<p>Cheers,
<br>Mrs Alison Ho
<br>Principal</p>
