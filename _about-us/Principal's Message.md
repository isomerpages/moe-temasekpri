**Mrs Alison Ho** 
<br>**Principal** 
<br>**Temasek Primary School**


Temasek Primary started school year 2022 well with “Temasek Starts Right”. The highlight was welcoming the new cohort of Temasekians into our school. In fact, we are happy to note that our Primary 1 students have settled into the school quickly. We appreciate the support from the parents in PCC and the Primary 4 students who were buddies to our new students. As we learn to live with COVID-19, Temasekians are still adhering strictly to the prevailing Safe Management Measures (SMMs). We are delighted to note the resilient and happy faces behind the masks.

We pride ourselves on the numerous platforms we have which seek to develop all Temasekians into responsible, versatile and future-ready citizens. We hope that the Temasek Leaders’ character pledge, Learn for Life lessons (LFL) based on Steven Covey’s 7 Habits, the six school core values of Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity, Open-Mindedness, Respect and Humility and our learning dispositions, ROAR (Responsibility, Open-Mindedness, Active-Learning and Resilience) will continue to guide our students in their pursuit of excellence in their learning journey while staying rooted in the right values.

We are proud to have maintained our high academic standards. Thanks to the dedication of our teachers, the rigour of our academic programmes and the strong collaboration with stakeholders to bring out the best in our students, Temasekians, both past and present, have accomplished much in different arenas. We will continue to fly the Temasek flag high as we look forward to many more great years ahead as we nurture future-ready students of character, poised to take on the world.

Finally, the words of our school song, “Keep the torch of knowledge burning” and “Serving our state with all our might” are words that we hope each and every Temasekian will remember and live out for many more years to come.

I would like to wish all staff members, students, parents and alumni members a fulfilling and joyful 2022. We look forward to an enriching year of learning and growth for our Temasekians in 2022.

  

Cheers to another year together – Forward Together, Temasek!
