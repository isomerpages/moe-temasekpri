**Mrs Alison Ho** 
<br>**Principal** 
<br>**Temasek Primary School**


Temasek Primary started school year 2023 well with our customary “Temasek Starts Right”, to set a good foundation for strong relationships and respectful interactions amongst staff and students in the course of the year.

We are happy to note that our Primary 1 students settled into the school quickly. We appreciate the support from our parent volunteers and the Primary 4 students who were buddies to our Primary 1 students. This year, we had another new first. We welcomed our first batch of MK1 students at the MOE Kindergarten (MK) @ Temasek. We look forward to collaborating closely with the MK teachers to bring rich learning to our Temasekians and MK students.

We pride ourselves on the numerous platforms we have which seek to develop all Temasekians into responsible, versatile and future-ready citizens. We hope that the Temasek Leaders’ Character Pledge, Learn for Life lessons (LFL) based on Steven Covey’s 7 Habits, the six school core values of Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity, Open-Mindedness, Respect and Humility and our learning dispositions, ROAR (Responsibility, Open-Mindedness, Active-Learning and Resilience) will continue to guide our students in their pursuit of excellence in their learning journey while staying rooted in the right values.

We are proud to have maintained our high academic standards. Thanks to the dedication of our teachers, the rigour of our academic programmes and the strong collaboration with stakeholders to bring out the best in our students, Temasekians, both past and present, have accomplished much in different arenas. We will continue to fly the Temasek flag high as we look forward to many more great years ahead as we nurture future-ready students of character, poised to take on the world.

Similarly, we are proud that the year started on a high with one of our Temasekians, Jayden Wee from Primary 6 Open-Mindedness, representing Singapore Primary School Sports Council (SPSSC) as a torch bearer during the National School Games Opening Ceremony in February this year.

Finally, the words of our school song, “Keep the torch of knowledge burning” and “Serving our state with all our might” are words that we hope each and every Temasekian will remember and live out for many good years, whilst in and beyond the halls of Temasek Primary.

I would like to wish all staff, students, parents and alumni a fulfilling and happy 2023. We look forward to another enriching year of learning and growth for our Temasekians in 2023.

Cheers to another great year together – Forward Together, Temasek!
