<p>Temasek Primary started academic year 2024 well with our customary “Temasek
Starts Right”, to set a good foundation for strong relationships and respectful
interactions amongst staff and students in the course of the year.</p>
<p>We are happy to note that our new cohort of Primary 1 Temasekians settled
into the school quickly. We appreciate the support from our parent volunteers
and the Primary 4 students who were buddies to our Primary 1 students.
This year, we had another new first. We welcomed our full cohort of MK1
and MK2 students at the MOE Kindergarten (MK @ Temasek). We look forward
to collaborating closely with the MK educators to bring rich learning to
our Temasekians and MK students. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on the numerous platforms we have which seek to develop
all Temasekians into responsible, versatile and future-ready citizens.
We hope that the Temasek Leaders’ Character Pledge, Learn for Life lessons
(LFL) based on Steven Covey’s 7 Habits, the six school core values of Perseverance,
Responsibility, Integrity, Open-Mindedness, Respect and Humility and our
learning dispositions, ROAR (Responsibility, Open-Mindedness, Active-Learning
and Resilience) will continue to guide our students in their pursuit of
excellence in their learning journey while staying rooted in the right
values.</p>
<p>At last year’s School Workplan Seminar, Minister Chan Chun Sing talked
about shaping the future of learning. Indeed, the road ahead may not be
pebbled with the same stones that we are familiar with, and as such, the
way we craft learning must help each of our young navigate their future
so that we can move forward as one. Minister talked about enabling every
student to be a Creator, Connector and Contributor.</p>
<p>In being a <strong><em>Creator</em></strong>, students will create new
value for an uncertain tomorrow. This vision is in alignment with our Temasek
student learner outcomes of being a Passionate Learner and Creative and
Critical thinker. Our programmes like Learning Tapestry where Temasekians
work together on an inter-disciplinary project, to think of solutions to
a problem presented, call for our students to exercise critical and inventive
thinking, while working collaboratively in teams.</p>
<p>In being a <strong><em>Connector</em></strong>, students should be able
to connect diverse people, bridge differences and seize opportunities.
This is an extension of our existing Temasek student learner outcome of
being an Effective Communicator who is able to communicate effectively
and respectfully, with tact and sensitivity, for meaningful purposes. In
addition, celebrating the main festivals in school like Chinese New Year,
Hari Raya and Deepavali, as well as learning from schools which are different
from ours, help our students learn more about and understand different
cultures. This is important for them to appreciate and respect diversity
to build bridges of connections. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And in being a <strong><em>Contributor</em></strong>, it is important that
our students know that they all have something to contribute, no matter
what their starting points are, much like being a Servant Leader in the
Temasek Primary context. Our Temasekians become buddies to give support
and assurance to Primary 1 students as the new students navigate Year 1
of primary school life. They may not know it but these buddies are making
a significant contribution to the Primary 1 students’ lives. Also, in the
course of the year, some of our Temasekians visit the residents in the
neighbouring blocks to bring some festive cheer, as a way of contributing
to the community. And internally, we acknowledge the various staff groups
where we involve our students in showing appreciation for others’ contributions.</p>
<p>Our Temasekians are all at different stages of their journey in being
a Creator, Connector and Contributor, and we hope to be able to provide
support for them as they pursue their own excellence.</p>
<p>Cheers to another great year together – Forward Together, Temasek!</p>
Cheers,<br>
Mrs Alison Ho<br>
