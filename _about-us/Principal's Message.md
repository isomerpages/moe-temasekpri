<p>We welcomed the academic year 2025 with our customary “Temasek Starts
Right”, to set a good foundation for strong relationships and respectful
interactions amongst staff and students in the course of the year. This
year, our Primary 3 and 4 students enjoyed a day camp as they got to know
their classmates better for a great 2025 together.</p>
<p>We are happy to welcome our new cohort of Primary 1 Temasekians and they
have settled into the school well and quickly. We appreciate the support
from our parent volunteers and the Primary 4 students who were buddies
to our Primary 1 students. This year, we welcomed our first batch of MK
@ Temasek students who have registered in our school for Primary 1. We
look forward to continued close collaboration with our MK educators to
bring rich learning to our Temasekians and MK children. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on the experiences we have curated for the different
levels which seek to develop all Temasekians into future-ready citizens
contributing effectively to society. We hope that the Temasek Leaders’
Character Pledge, Learn for Life lessons (LFL) based on Steven Covey’s
7 Habits, the six school core values of Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity,
Open-Mindedness, Respect and Humility and our learning dispositions, ROAR
(Responsibility, Open-Mindedness, Active-Learning and Resilience) will
continue to guide our students in their pursuit of excellence in their
learning journey while being anchored by the right values.</p>
<p>In preparing our students to be future-ready citizens, we are placing
increasingly greater emphasis on our students’ knowledge of current affairs.
It is important that they are aware of relevant local and global concerns
now to be in a better position to make good and responsible decisions in
the future, with a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of issues
and how they have evolved over the years. More importantly, we also hope
to develop our students’ civic literacy as they make sense of how issues
affect them and their community, as well as the appropriate responses.
We seek all parents’ and guardians’ support in this pursuit.</p>
<p>We are incredibly grateful for the encouraging Temasek community, made
up of parents and other stakeholders who have stood with us. Much of what
we do is possible because of this support. We are confident that we will
be able to take our students to greater heights this year, in their different
growth areas, as we continue to celebrate different successes.</p>
<p>Cheers to another great year together – <em>Forward Together, Temasek</em>!</p>
<p>Cheers,
<br>Mrs Alison Ho
<br>Principal</p>
