### Our School Song

Insert school song audio clip here.

We are young, we are strong   

  

In spirit as one we shall belong,

  

Pure in thought and word and deed

  

Loyal to Temasek we shall lead.

  

_**Chorus**_

Forward Together, Temasek

  

On to glory, on to fame.

  

Keep the torch of knowledge burning,

  

On to life always learning.

  

With friends here, we will share,

  

Our lives and work with love and care.

  

Always true to God and right,

  

Serving our state with all our might.
