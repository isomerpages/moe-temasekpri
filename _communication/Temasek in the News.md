##### Congratulations to Mr Martin Goh (LH Math), for being awarded Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA) 2019!

Martin is a strong proponent of experiential learning and instills in his students a love for Mathematics through play.  
  
Martin creates innovative games and activities to pique students' interest in Mathematics. He came up with the idea of the Multiplication Challenge which uses flash cards to challenge students to remember as many multiplication facts as they can within a given time. For Martin, learning should not be constrained by the walls of classrooms or restricted to curriculum time. He transformed the games corner in the classroom into a Mathematics Mobile Games Cart, so that students could access the maths manipulatives anywhere.  
  

Martin used to teach in a Secondary school. As a cross-level deployed teacher, he goes the extra mile to keep abreast of strategies appropriate for his current students by participating in Networked Learning Communities.

  

In order to prepare his students for life, he encourages his young charges to participate in co-curricular activities such as Scouts National Gang Show 2018 and Combined Uniform Group Camp; activities that challenge them to step out of their comfort zone. These are also opportunities to instil in his students strong values.

  

For his commitment to continuously improve himself and help his students discover the joy of learning, Martin is conferred the Outstanding Youth in Education Award 2019.<br>

Received a new hybrid orchid - Dendrobium Temasek President’s Challenge - created by Temasek Primary School students, a strong supporter and donor of President’s Challenge. I would like to thank them for this lovely gift, and for their support for the President’s Challenge. 

  

Temasek Primary School students shared that the purple colour represents royalty, respect, admiration and dignity while the white lines represent people from all walks of life, regardless of culture, religion or family background, coming together to contribute their time, talent and resources to help those who are less fortunate in the community.

#### 全国模范华文教师专访

（2012-05-25）

淡马锡小学华文科主任陈琦蕊（36岁）今年负责全级华文成绩最弱的小六班级，很多学生连识字都有问题，但是她却“大胆”要求他们以大哥哥、大姐姐的身份去为小一生讲故事，由小朋友打分。

  

因为“不想丢脸”，这些会考生都很努力地准备，主动开始拿起华文书本，重温一些他们早已不认识的华文字。

  

**Inspiring Chinese Language Teacher Award**

We are proud of our staff, Mrs Sophie Wang, for being conferred the Inspiring Chinese Language Teacher Award . This award is organised by Lianhe Zaobao with co-organisers being the Singapore Middle School Chinese Teachers’ Association and the Singapore Chinese Teachers’ Union. The Award is endorsed by the Ministry of Education and is sponsored by the Lee Foundation.

  

  

This award is given to teachers who are able to arouse students’ interest in the Chinese Language and Culture through creative teaching or through co-curricular activities. The awardees would have shown dedication in helping students in their learning, and demonstrated care and concern for, and understanding of their students.<br>


#### Pupil's Our Pride  

**Temasek's Very Own Budding Actress - ' Little Emily '**

  

Our talented P5 pupil, Melissa Hecker, acted in the musical, Emily, as the little Emily. A few of our pupils and their family members as well as the Form Teacher, Miss Jill Wong, attended the musical on 21 May 2016. Her classmates with encouragement from Miss Jill Wong, made a special card with words of encouragement and well wishes for her. One of the pupils presented the card and flowers to her after the musical. Melissa was surprised by the act of her classmates. Her mother, too, was touched by the gesture of Melissa’s classmates and thanked the pupils and Form Teacher. Melissa’s classmates have demonstrated kindness through their kind words and acts.
