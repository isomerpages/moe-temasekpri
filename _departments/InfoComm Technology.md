<h3>ICT</h3>
<p>At Temasek Primary School, we believe that preparing students for the
digital age means developing strong values alongside digital skills. Our
ICT programme is designed not only to equip students with essential technological
competencies, but also to nurture ethical thinking, responsible online
behaviour, and a sense of integrity. We aim to develop future-ready learners
who are creative, confident and guided by sound values as they navigate
an increasingly digital world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From Primary 1 to 6, students build a strong foundation in digital literacy
through our ICT curriculum. They learn to use word processing, spreadsheet,
and presentation tools effectively, while being guided to communicate respectfully,
present information accurately, and use digital platforms with care. These
early habits help students understand that technology is a tool for meaningful
learning, collaboration and positive contribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our Learning Tapestry across levels integrate ICT meaningfully to create
authentic learning experiences. Students are encouraged to think critically,
ask responsible questions, and consider the ethical implications of technology
use. Students are encouraged to think about the real-world impact of their
creations and design solutions that reflect responsibility, care and ethical
decision-making. Through discussions, they learn to approach digital tools
with thoughtfulness and purpose.</p>
<p>In Primary 3 and 4, students are introduced to Generative AI. These experiences
spark curiosity and creativity while reinforcing the importance of using
AI responsibly. Students learn that digital tools can support learning
and help them explore ideas in constructive ways.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As students move on to Primary 5 and 6, they deepen their digital competencies
through the Code for Fun programme. Here, they explore more advanced coding
concepts while developing teamwork, perseverance and empathy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Across all subjects, ICT is integrated to support values-driven learning.
Whether students are collaborating on projects, practising cyber wellness,
or conducting digital research, they are continually reminded to stay safe,
respectful and responsible online.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Temasek Primary School, we are committed to developing digitally skilled
learners who uphold strong values—students who are not only prepared for
the future but also ready to shape it positively.</p>
