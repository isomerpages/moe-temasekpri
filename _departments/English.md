<p>The vision of the English Language department is for our students to become&nbsp;<strong>future global citizens who are articulate and effective users of the English Language</strong>.
This is in alignment with our school's student learner outcome of 'Effective
Communicator' and MOE's C2015 student outcome of 'Confident Person'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The English Language curriculum in Temasek is designed to lay a strong
foundation for the learning of core language skills as well as develop
in our students a love for the language. Students continue to gain mastery
of these skills as they participate in the learning of language in authentic
and meaningful contexts of use.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning And Reading)</h5>
<p>STELLAR is an MOE (Ministry of Education) initiative to develop children
who love reading and have a strong foundation in the English Language.
Through STELLAR, the department aims to focus on oral communication and
enjoyment of the language by introducing students to a variety of print
and non-print resources as well as literature texts to promote appreciation
and use of the language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Primary 1 and 2, our students learn to read for understanding and enjoyment
and are explicitly taught language items, structures and skills through
the Shared Book Approach (SBA). In the Modified Language Experience Approach
(MLEA), students are engaged in fun and interesting shared experiences.
Students are encouraged to talk about their experiences as a class and
then write about them. From Primary 3 to Primary 6, students are explicitly
taught language items, structures and skills through strategies like Supported
Reading, KWL and Retelling.</p>
<h5>STAGE IT (Share and Talk about Anything in Good English In Temasek)</h5>
<p>To fulfil the schools student learner outcome of 'Effective Communicator',
the pupils engage in 'STAGE IT' where they work collaboratively with their
parents and teachers on their speech before presenting to their classmates.
Feedback from the teacher and peers is then given through the use of rubrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h5>Reading Programme – Take the Lead, Start to Read!&nbsp; &nbsp;</h5>
<p>In Temasek, we believe that reading is the foundation for effective language
literacy acquisition. We aim to build a community of avid, lifelong readers
through fun and exciting programmes. All students are expected to engage
in silent reading before the start of each school day. Each class is assigned
a collection of books to increase their exposure to recommended reads.
To instil a love for reading among students, platforms are provided for
Primary 1 to 6 students to share and promote books that they enjoy reading
to their peers during their English lessons.</p>

<h5>W2iT (Write Well in Temasek)</h5>
<p>Our writing programme aims to increase the engagement of our students
in writing and develop writing competence. Adopting the Writer’s Workshop
approach at Primary 1, students are encouraged to write about their personal
experiences. The writing process – idea generation, writing drafts, revising,
editing and finally publishing their writing, is explicitly taught and
continues to be emphasised at Primary 2. The teacher acts as a mentor author,
modelling writing techniques and conferring with students as they move
through the writing process. Direct writing instruction takes place in
the form of mini-lessons that focus on a range of topics.</p>
<p>From Primary 3 to 6, a customised writing package is used to develop in
our students the essential skills of writing personal recounts based on
a given structure to suit the purpose, audience and context. At Primary
5 and 6, we equip our students with the necessary writing skills using
a comprehensive and detailed writing package which includes effective Writer’s
Workshop strategies, writing resources from ELIS, exemplars, checklists
and other resources. We hope that with the availability of such a package,
our pupils will become Passionate Learners, Effective Communicators, and
Critical and Creative Thinkers in the future.</p>
<p>Each class is assigned a collection of books to increase their exposure
to recommended reads. To instil a love for reading among students, platforms
are provided for Primary 1 to 6 students to share and promote books that
they enjoy reading to their peers before the morning assembly. The department
also involves our parents as ‘mystery readers’ to read stories to our Primary
1 and 2 pupils during their recesses.</p>
<h5>Drama in Temasek</h5>
<p>Drama helps our students to express themselves through verbal and non-verbal
ways. Drama activities conducted as part of the English language curriculum
develop our students’ confidence in speaking, improve oral communication
skills and promote teamwork. Our students also develop social skills and
empathy as they take on the perspectives of different characters in stories.
In Temasek, drama is an integral part of the English Language curriculum
and drama activities are designed to complement the STELLAR units covered
in the English lessons. Through the use of drama, our young learners are
engaged in critical thinking and perspective taking.</p>
<h5>LiT (Literature In Temasek)&nbsp;</h5>
<p>LiT is a customised school-based curriculum differentiated to meet the
needs of the Primary 3 to Primary 6 students in Temasek. Students are actively
engaged in various activities such as character analysis and comparison,
role play and debate to promote an appreciation of English Literature and
a love for reading. The LiT programme will be based on the following texts:</p>

<h5>Junior Reporters</h5>
<p>The Junior Reporters Programme was implemented for the Primary 2 students
in 2021. It provides a platform for students to hone their oral communication
skills by using the English Language in an authentic setting. In this programme,
students learn basic interviewing skills and how to write a basic interview
report before presenting their findings in front of an audience.&nbsp;</p>
