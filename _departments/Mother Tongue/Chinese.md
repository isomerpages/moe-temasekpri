**Mother Tongue Fortnight 2021**  
<br>The Chinese Language Mother Tongue Language Fortnight was held from 1 March till 12 March 2021 for the P3-P6 students and P1-P2 students 12 July 2021 to 23 July 2021. The purpose of this school-wide event is to create an immersive environment for the learning of Mother Tongue languages, through various activities to raise awareness for students to know more about their culture. 

  

Chinese Culture has a rich heritage and history and filled with wisdom and knowledge. In orders to broaden the students’ horizon and having a deeper understanding of one’s culture, the Chinese department has planned 6 different cultural themes for various levels as below.

  

P1 and P2 students were exposed to Chinese traditional games. P1 students had fun time decorating their spinning top and competing against each other using their colourful tops.  P2 students made shuttlecock out of recycled materials and had their share of fun kicking their handmade shuttlecock.

  

P3 and P4 students learnt about traditional great inventions where they became aware of the origin and significant role the invention played in the olden days. P3 students got to know how printing was done and had opportunity to arrange the Chinese characters blocks and tried printing out the words themselves. P4 students learnt about the use of kites in war time and had fun making the kite and trying to fly them after it is completed.

  

P5 and P6 students were introduced to the Chinese traditional arts. P5 students tried to make their own bamboo book while the P6 tried painting their own traditional fans.

**2021 Chinese Language Game Competition for P4**

**《天才西游》华文智力游戏比赛**  

  

The much anticipated Annual C-idiom competition for Primary Fours were held in Term 4.  As the C-Idiom Game used to be board games, due to Covid-19 pandemic, the C-Idiom Game Team from the Chinese Department had revamped the game and digitalized it. We made use of Gimkit to engage our students from various P4 Chinese Class.

For this digitalized version of C-idiom competition, all participants had to go through a few rounds where the top three finalists would emerge from each class.  Each classroom was filled with excitement and energy where everyone tried their best to outwit their opponents to advance in the game. 

  

After several rounds of intense competition of wits and knowledge of the Chinese Idioms and sayings, there are three winners from each class.
