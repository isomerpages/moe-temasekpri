<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong> provides a rich and immersive
experience for students to discover, explore, and connect with Chinese
language and culture in meaningful ways. Spanning two weeks, students participate
in a variety of interactive classroom activities conducted in-house and
by external vendors, as well as fun recess activities supported by parent
volunteers. Beyond the classroom, the <strong>Chinese Language and Cultural Camp</strong> offers
students’ hands-on experiences that make learning Chinese language and
culture more authentic and engaging. Focusing on themes such as Chinese
performing arts and traditional games, students learn new vocabulary and
gain first-hand exposure to cultural practices. Through these activities,
our lower-primary students experience the joy of learning and develop a
greater awareness and appreciation of Chinese language and culture.</p>
