## Tamil Language 
#### Key Programmes / Activities 

1.	Reading Programme
The department employs a wide range of reading resources to nurture students’ interest in reading. These include selected Tamil Murasu articles, a variety of contemporary classroom storybooks, and engaging story kits for Primary 3 to Primary 6 pupils.

2.	MT Fortnight & TL Camp
The Mother Tongue Fortnight initiative engages students in a variety of language and cultural activities, providing meaningful exposure beyond the classroom. This two-week programme creates an immersive environment that enriches students’ learning beyond academics. The school also organises an annual, fun-filled half-day Tamil Language Camp featuring telematches, traditional games, dance, art and craft, and Indian martial arts. The camp aims to provide every child with opportunities to explore their leadership potential and deepen their appreciation for the aesthetics and cultural heritage.

3.	External & Internal Competitions
All our students taking Tamil Language from Primary 1 to Primary 6 are encouraged to participate in various Tamil language competitions organised by external organisations, such as Mediacorp’s annual Spelling Bee, as well as cluster and zonal-level competitions. Students take part in a wide range of events including storytelling, singing, fancy dress, essay writing, oratorical presentations and poetry recitation. The school also conducts similar level-based internal competitions in Term 4 for all students from Primary 1 to Primary 6.
