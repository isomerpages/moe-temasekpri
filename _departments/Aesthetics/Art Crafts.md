<p><strong>Arts Department Strategic Destination</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A visually captivating and welcoming learning campus which brings people
together to inspire, nurture to enjoy arts and culture by going through
the creative processes using the 8 Studio Habits.</p>
<p><strong>TOWARDS A VIBRANT ART CULTURE IN TEMASEK</strong>
</p>
<p>TEMASEK ART GALLERY around Temasek.</p>
<p>There are art spaces around Temasek which strive to create an exhibition
presentation with both conventional and new media. These spaces showcase,
our studentsâ€™ works as well as how our teachers have creatively interpreted
and expressed their ideas through art.</p>
<p>We hope students would gain a deeper appreciation for art when they dive
deeper into the meaning behind the artworks and discover how art can convey
stories about people and environment.</p>
<p>Those art spaces exist as constructed social spaces, inviting interaction
and discussion about the artworks.</p>

<p>We have also incorporated Studio Habits into our art curriculum lessons
as all these 8 habits are the creative processes through art making.

<h4>Museum-based Learning</h4>

<p>As we embark in a new curriculum, students are expected to go to museums
to understand and learn more about certain artworks by local artistes as
it would be inter-connected with subjects such as Social studies as well.
Hence apart from going out of school we have included some wall murals
of these artworks in school bringing the museum to the student in Temasek
Primary.</p>
<h4>P6 Graduation Wall</h4>
<p>After 6 years of being a Temasek pupil each student would be moving on
to the next chapter of their&nbsp;education journey but before they do,
we would like them to remember Temasek Primary where&nbsp;they were molded
for 6 years. Graduating students go through different art programs after
their PSLE.</p>
