**Arts Department Strategic Destination** 

A visually captivating and welcoming learning campus which brings people together to inspire, nurture to enjoy arts and culture by going through the creative processes using the 8 Studio Habits.

**TOWARDS A VIBRANT ART CULTURE IN TEMASEK**  

TEMASEK ART GALLERY around Temasek.

There are art spaces around Temasek which strive to create an exhibition presentation with both conventional and new media. These spaces showcase, our students’ works as well as how our teachers have creatively interpreted and expressed their ideas through art.

We hope students would gain a deeper appreciation for art when they dive deeper into the meaning behind the artworks and discover how art can convey stories about people and environment.

Those art spaces exist as constructed social spaces, inviting interaction and discussion about the artworks.

###### Studio Habits in ART

<img src="/images/art3.png" style="width:240px;height:220px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> We have also incorporated Studio Habits into our art curriculum lessons as all these 8 habits are the creative processes through art making.

###### Museum-based Learning

<img src="/images/art4.png" style="width:240px;height:220px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> As we embark in a new curriculum, students are expected to go to museums to understand and learn more about certain artworks by local artistes as it would be inter-connected with subjects such as Social studies as well. Hence apart from going out of school we have included some wall murals of these artworks in school bringing the museum to the student in Temasek Primary.

###### P6 Graduation Wall

After 6 years of being a Temasek pupil each student would be moving on to the next chapter of their education journey but before they do, we would like them to remember Temasek Primary where they were molded for 6 years. Graduating students go through different art programs after their PSLE.
