##### Temasek Talent Fiesta  


The Temasek Talent Fiesta creates a platform for Temasek's budding and experienced performers to hone their performance skills and build up their confidence as they work on their stage presence. While nurture students to become passionate learners, we hope that this platform encourages students to demonstrate what being a passionate performer is all about.

  

The Temasek Talent Fiesta is a very well received event with students performing their favourite songs through singing, playing on instrument such as the piano or violin, and choreographing their own dance items. Through this event, many hidden talents were discovered in the areas of the performing arts.

  

The performances are also given the opportunity to perform on bigger stages for our school events such as Magic Land and Speech Day.

##### Enrichment Programmes  

Temasek offers a wide range of enrichment programmes designed to allow every student to have opportunities to create and perform music actively. We hope to provide them with an authentic music making experience that forms the basics to develop within them an informed and life-long involvement in music.

  

Students 'play-to-learn' different wind, string, and percussion instruments individually and in an ensemble through the various programme offered:

  

1.  Global music module- Musicals, Opera, Western Classical, Music from Malaysia, Japan, New Zealand, India, Thailand
2.  Percussion module- STOMP
3.  Creation module- Loopimal, GarageBand, Incredibox, Foley
4.  Strings module- Ukulele, guitar
5.  Performance module- P1/2 Rising Stars, P6 PopBand
6.  Hip-Hop module- Rapping

  

Music has the ability to unite people and it plays a vital role in many cultures and societies. Through a wide exposure to music from both local and global cultures, students will be able to gain insights to other cultures and be open-minded towards the different types of music around them and in the world. This increases their global awareness as well as their sensitivity and understanding towards others.

  

As listening is a key process in music education, students learn how to activate their musical ears to listen attentively and thoughtfully to different types of music by questioning and wondering deeper in the understanding of the purpose and meaning of music.

  

We hope that through these programmes, students will develop their ability for creative expression and be able to communicate with others effectively through music. Our programmes require no musical expertise so every child can benefit from the varied programmes offered in Temasek.
