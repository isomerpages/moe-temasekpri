<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p><strong>SPACE (School-Parent Acing Children’s Experiences)</strong>
</p>
<p>The school provides every student in Primary 1 to Primary 4 the opportunity
to appreciate and enjoy Mathematics through the SPACE (School-Parent Acing
Children’s Experiences) Programme. SPACE is an innovative programme that
allows for greater integration of learning and teaching across disciplines
in fun and creative ways, making mathematical concepts more meaningful
and engaging for young learners. As part of this initiative, every Primary
1 to Primary 4 student receives a Home Kit that they can bring home to
carry out hands-on activities with their parents or siblings. Through these
shared experiences, the school hopes that the close interaction between
parent and child in the learning process will foster positive attitudes
towards the learning of Mathematics. We also hope to encourage students
to explore and discover new ideas, and strengthen their confidence and
curiosity in the learning of the subject.</p>
<p><strong>STEMS (Striving Towards Excellence in Mathematical Skills)</strong>
</p>
<p>All students from Primary 1 to Primary 6 will be taught the different
heuristics for problem-solving using the heuristic booklet – STEMS (<strong>S</strong>triving <strong>T</strong>owards <strong>E</strong>xcellence
in <strong>M</strong>athematical <strong>S</strong>kills) which is designed
by our own team of Mathematics teachers. Primary 1 &amp; Primary 2 students
will learn the basic skills in model drawing using the part-whole and simple
comparison models. The learning of this skill will then spiral upwards
to Primary 3 and Primary 4 where students will learn the comparison model
and in Primary 5 and Primary 6, advanced model drawing skills will be taught.</p>
<p>By the end of the sixth year, the department hopes that all students are
competent in the application of model drawing and heuristics for problem-solving.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Problem Sums (DPS)</strong>
</p>
<p>The central focus of the mathematics curriculum is the development of
mathematical problem-solving competency. Students learn to apply their
learning of Mathematics concepts and extend this understanding to solving
problems in a variety of contexts. In this programme, Primary 1 to Primary
6 students are exposed to different types of problem sums on a regular
basis in the classroom, ensuring that they gradually build confidence,
flexibility and resilience in tackling both routine and non-routine questions.
This continual exposure creates opportunities for students to develop key
competencies that are important in the 21st century, in particular, Critical,
Adaptive and Inventive Thinking. These competencies equip students not
only for academic success but also for real-world problem-solving beyond
the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Learning (P1 to 4)</strong>
</p>
<p>This Mathematics programme is designed to create opportunities for Primary
1 to Primary 4 students to think critically, reason logically and communicate
effectively using mathematics. It enables them to apply their learning
with confidence in a variety of authentic contexts in the school environment.
Students work collaboratively in groups to discuss ideas, justify solutions
and learn from one another, strengthening both their conceptual understanding
and interpersonal skills. The use of ICT tools in the learning of mathematics
further enhances students’ engagement in the learning of Mathematics. These
approaches help to foster interest in Mathematics by showing students the
relevance and joy of mathematical thinking in daily life.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematical Olympiad Training Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the school’s enrichment programme, selected Primary 4 to Primary
6 students are offered the Mathematical Olympiad Training Programme. It
is designed to stretch and extend their mathematical abilities beyond the
standard curriculum. The objectives of this programme are to develop higher-order
problem-solving skills and stimulate creative and critical thinking in
Mathematics. This will enable students to approach complex tasks with flexibility.
Through exposure to challenging and non-routine questions, students gain
deeper insights into advanced problem-solving strategies and learn to analyse
problems from multiple perspectives. The programme also aims to equip students
with greater confidence in solving non-routine questions. This will help
them to persevere through difficult tasks and build resilience as independent
learners.</p>
