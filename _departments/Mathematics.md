<h5>Philosophy/ Rationale</h5>
<p>Mathematics is an excellent vehicle for the development and improvement
of a personâ€™s intellectual competence in logical reasoning, spatial visualisation,
analysis and abstract thought. Mathematics education in Temasek aims to
enable pupils to acquire the necessary mathematical concepts and skills
for everyday life, and for continuous learning in mathematics and related
disciplines. It seeks to develop in pupils an appreciation of mathematics
as an important and powerful tool in everyday life.</p>
<h5>Vision</h5>
<p>Every pupil is a self directed and competent problem solver who is effective
is thinking and mathematical communication.</p>
<h5>Learner Outcomes</h5>
<p>At the end of the 6-year programme, pupils would be able to:-</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use their knowledge of mathematical concepts to reason logically and communicate
mathematically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply their mathematical thinking and problem solving skills to formulate
and solve problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select and use effective strategies to solve closed, open-ended and non-routine
problems and evaluate their solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek alternative ways of solving the same problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present elegant solutions to problems and check the appropriateness and
reasonableness of the answer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognise connections between mathematical ideas, and between mathematics
and other disciplines, and between mathematics and everyday life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop positive attitudes towards mathematics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Key Understanding</h5>
<p>Every Temasekian will understand that</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mathematical problem solving is central to mathematics learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematics is a language consisting of clearly defined terms and symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematics is the study of data, patterns and relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematics is an integrated whole, not merely isolated pieces of knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematics is a tool used to solve real- world problems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Approach/ Framework</h5>
<p>Mathematics is a hierarchical subject. Higher concepts and skills are
built upon the more foundational ones and have to be learnt in a logical
sequence. A spiral approach is adopted to build up the concepts and skills
across the strands and up the levels. Pupils develop mathematical concepts
and skills progressively from the concrete and pictorial levels to the
abstract level.</p>
