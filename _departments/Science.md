<h3><strong>Science</strong></h3>
<p>The Science department embraces the motto “Do &amp; Discover.” Teachers
guide students in hands-on experiments that allow them to experience the
scientific process first-hand. Through careful observation and the use
of data and evidence, students learn to make thoughtful inferences and
communicate their findings effectively.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Students engage in inquiry-based learning that promotes curiosity, exploration
and critical thinking. Through hands-on experiments, they apply scientific
facts, concepts and principles while developing essential process skills
such as observing, comparing, classifying, using scientific apparatus,
communicating, inferring, predicting, analysing, generating possibilities,
evaluating, and formulating hypotheses.</p>
<p><strong>Life Sciences Programme</strong>
<br>With rapid advancements in science and technology and the increasing importance
of life sciences in the 21st century, it is vital for students to develop
curiosity about their environment and understand how scientific principles
and innovations shape the world around them.</p>
<p>The Science Department has designed a comprehensive programme that engages
students in life sciences from an early age. Through hands-on activities,
students make predictions, observe scientific phenomena, and learn in authentic
contexts such as growing fungi and edible plants, cultivating vegetables
using hydroponics, and experimenting with orchid hybridisation. These experiences
make Science come alive and help students develop a deeper appreciation
of its relevance in their everyday lives.</p>

<p><strong>STEM ALP on Sustainability: Caring for the Environment and Community</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) empowers students to apply
scientific concepts and coding skills to tackle real-world challenges.
Rooted in scientific inquiry, the programme nurtures curiosity and creativity
as students explore how STEM can be harnessed to design innovative, sustainable
solutions that benefit both people and the environment.</p>
<p>Through projects such as designing wind-powered vehicles, floating or
energy-efficient homes, and smart home prototypes, students apply scientific
principles with a strong emphasis on environmental stewardship. These hands-on
experiences foster collaboration, innovation, and leadership, deepening
students’ appreciation of how Science and technology can drive sustainability.</p>
