### Science

The vision of the Science department is **‘Do & Discover’** . Teachers and students are encouraged to conduct hands-on experiments where they will experience the scientific process first hand. Through careful observation and the use of data or evidence, students are taught to make thoughtful inferences and communicate their findings.

#### Key Programmes

**1) Inquiry-based Learning**<br>
Students engage in inquiry-based learning using the BSCS (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study) 5E model. The 5Es stand for Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate. Students carry out hands-on experiments and apply scientific facts, concepts and principles using basic process skills. Some of the basic process skills include observing, comparing, classifying, using apparatus and equipment, communicating, inferring, predicting, analysing, generating possibilities, evaluating and formulating a hypothesis.

  

**2) Life Sciences Programme**<br>
With the advancement in Science and Technology and the importance of life sciences in the 21st century, students need to be curious about their environment and the applications of scientific principles and technological advancement in the real world. The Science Department has designed a comprehensive programme to involve students in life sciences from young.

  

These are the four modules assigned to the Primary Three to Six students as shown in the table below:

| Level 	| Module 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|
| Primary 3 	| Life Cycle of a Mealworm 	|
| Primary 4 	| Life Cycle of a Lady’s Finger Plant 	|
| Primary 5 	| Hydroponics 	|
| Primary 6 	| Orchid Hybridisation 	|

**3) Use of STaRs Kits, Dataloggers and other IT resources**

Teachers have developed STaRs Kits (Science Teaching and Resource Kits for Students) for a few physical science topics such as heat, magnets, electricity and light. Students carry out hands-on experiments using these STaRs kits. The Primary Three students will embark on mobile learning using iPads. The students work in groups and are assigned a task where they need to search for answers using the clues uploaded in an application on the iPad.
