### **Former Temasek Primary and Secondary site**
The former Temasek Primary and Secondary site at New Upper Changi Road/ Bedok South Road is earmarked for future housing development and there are plans to demolish the school buildings around 2Q2026 (tentative). 

MOE is working with relevant agencies to explore the possibility of facilitating interested alumni/ staff to visit the former school site before its demolition. We will share more details when ready.

**Update as at 30 July 2025**: 
MOE has been working with relevant agencies to explore the possibility of a visit to the former school site before its demolition. After further study, the assessment is that the state of the buildings at the former school site is not suitable for a visit.
