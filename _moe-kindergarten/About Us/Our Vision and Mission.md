#### A strong start for every child
**Our vision** is to provide a strong start for every child.
We strongly believe in nurturing the children to their best potential - where they will be well-equipped with skills as lifelong learners.
We seek to do so through providing quality pre-school education that is affordable to Singaporeans and catalysing quality improvements in the sector.

#### The MK Logo

The flying kite in our logo represents our children soaring to greater heights, with the strong foundation they have built in the MOE Kindergartens. The two kite tails symbolise the fun and learning that children will experience in the MOE Kindergartens.

The three colours represent the educators, partners and the curriculum, which are integral to the holistic growth and development of the child.
