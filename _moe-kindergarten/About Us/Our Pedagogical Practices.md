#### Engaging children in learning through purposeful play
At MK, teachers engage children in learning through purposeful play. While children actively participate in play that is enjoyable and meaningful, teachers observe them to support and guide their play to achieve important learning outcomes.

#### Extending children’s learning through quality interactions
Teachers also seek to extend children’s learning through quality interactions. This involves teachers and children engaging in frequent and extended conversations to build on ideas and concepts.
Teachers ask questions and use prompts to understand children’s thinking and learning process. They encourage children to put into words and their thoughts or what they have seen, heard, experienced, and learnt.
By listening respectfully to what children have to say, teachers build trust and strengthen the relationship between them, which enables children to be confident in asking questions and seeking answers to their questions.
