<p>Our curriculum is specially designed based on MOE’s <a href="https://www.nel.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework</a>.
This is where we believe that children are joyful, active, curious and
competent learners, and we aim to nurture your child holistically to be
lifelong learners. In addition, we believe that children learn best through
an integrated approach and intentionally planned learning activities.</p>
<p>MK offers classes in the 3 official MTLs (Chinese, Malay and Tamil). We
encourage children of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnic race to take their
own MTLs.</p>

<h5>Curriculum: Our Flagship Programmes</h5>
<p><strong>Starlight Literacy Program - Early Childhood Literacy</strong>
<br>Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process that begins in infancy
and early childhood and continues throughout the schooling years. In early
childhood, the focus is on developing children’s listening and speaking
skills. An active, interactive approach helps to nurture children’s interest
in learning languages.</p>
<p>We use Big Books, songs, rhymes and games to help your child to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop listening, speaking and early literacy skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) (i.e. Chinese, Malay
or Tamil language).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate with confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn about local customs and traditions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) and Bilingualism</strong>Bilingualism
is a cornerstone of Singapore’s education system. Learning our MTL gives
us direct access to our cultural heritage, and can help us better understand
our values, roots and identities.</p>
<p>At MK, we nurture bilingualism by focusing on listening, speaking and
engaging children in games and activities that encourage early literacy
development.</p>
<p>By using their MTL to communicate with teachers and their friends on a
daily basis, children build a strong foundation that will prepare them
for language learning in later years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>HI-Light Programme</strong>
<br>The HI-Light Programme is designed to support the holistic development
of children across these six learning areas through an integrated approach
to learning. It provides children opportunities to explore, discover and
learn about the world around them.</p>

<p><strong>Weeks of Wonder (WoW) Projects</strong>
<br><strong>Collaborative and Self-directed Learning</strong>
<br>Each term at MOE Kindergarten (MK) culminates in a Weeks of Wonder (WoW)
project. In a year, children complete 2 WoW projects in English and another
2 in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Children will work together with
their friends on a topic of their choice.</p>
<p>Through WoW projects, children learn how to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>make their own decisions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop problem-solving, process and investigative skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collaborate with one another</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>communicate effectively in English and their MTL</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the process of finding answers to their own questions, WoW projects
allow children to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>experience the joy of self-motivated learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build their confidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen their learning dispositions or positive behaviours and attitudes
towards learning</p>
</li>
</ul>
