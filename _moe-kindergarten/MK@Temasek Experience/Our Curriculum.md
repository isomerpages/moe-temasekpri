Our curriculum is specially designed based on MOEâ€™s <a href="https://www.nel.moe.edu.sg/">Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework</a>. This is where we believe that children are joyful, active, curious and competent learners, and we aim to nurture your child holistically to be lifelong learners. In addition, we believe that children learn best through an integrated approach and intentionally planned learning activities.

MK offers classes in the 3 official MTLs (Chinese, Malay and Tamil). We encourage children of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnic race to take their own MTLs.
