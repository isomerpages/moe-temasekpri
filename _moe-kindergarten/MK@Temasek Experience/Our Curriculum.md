Our curriculum is specially designed based on MOE’s <a href="https://www.nel.moe.edu.sg/">Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework</a>. This is where we believe that children are joyful, active, curious and competent learners, and we aim to nurture your child holistically to be lifelong learners. In addition, we believe that children learn best through an integrated approach and intentionally planned learning activities.

MK offers classes in the 3 official MTLs (Chinese, Malay and Tamil). We encourage children of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnic race to take their own MTLs.

##### Curriculum: Our Flagship Programmes
###### Starlight Literacy Program - Early Childhood Literacy
Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process that begins in infancy and early childhood and continues throughout the schooling years. In early childhood, the focus is on developing children’s listening and speaking skills. An active, interactive approach helps to nurture children’s interest in learning languages.

We use Big Books, songs, rhymes and games to help your child to:
<ul>
	<li>Develop listening, speaking and early literacy skills.</li>
	<li>Enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) (i.e. Chinese, Malay or Tamil language).</li>
	<li>Communicate with confidence.</li>
	<li>Learn about local customs and traditions.</li>
</ul>
