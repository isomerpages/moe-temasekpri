#### Objectives

The CCA aims to nurture individuals who:

1.  can play the sport well.<br>
2.  are good team players by being able to communicate well and understand that teamwork is important in order for them to achieve their goals.

Netball is a non-contact sport. Netball helps the girls to improve in their hand-eye-coordination and motor skills.  The game of netball emphasises on teamwork and allows the girls to develop social skills. 

  

  

Unlike basketball, the game of netball does not allow any individual player to operate independently. Many of the player positions in netball are restricted to less than half the court. Therefore, the netball team focuses on teamwork to be able to attack, defend and score goals.
