#### Objectives

• To develop an appreciation of Taekwondo as a sport and as an art<br>
• To inculcate the right values in members<br>
• To provide students with optimum opportunities to develop their potential and achieve top placing in all divisions in NSG

In taekwondo, our students learn and understand that taekwondo is an art and sport –requires both mental and physical discipline. Our Taekwondo team train regularly and sharpen their techniques. This sport allows students to be as active as possible as we have students ranging from Primary Three to Primary Six.

This CCA develops students’ confidence and good sportsmanship as they prepare for grading and competitions. Under the guidance of our head coach, Mr Tan Cheng Hui, our students trained hard and some with potential are sent to participate in the National Inter-School Championship.
