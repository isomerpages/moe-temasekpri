#### Objectives

\- Excite students about the possibilities of Infocomm in a fun way.<br>
\- Equip students with relevant infocomm skills.<br>
\- Provide students with opportunities to express creativity, entrepreneurship and community spirit.

In Content Creation Club, we will equip the students with new technology skills like photography, videography and animation.  Besides taking up responsibility of the photo-taking or videoing of school events, students will also have opportunities to take up leading roles in coaching their peers in these various skills at Vision Centre.  We will also provide students with opportunities to express their creativity by supporting all interested participants for external competition. 

Building up the students’ ability in technology skills is not the only focus in Content Creation Club, we believe strongly that character building is as important.  We strive to nurture our technology-savvy members with a heart to serve the school community.
