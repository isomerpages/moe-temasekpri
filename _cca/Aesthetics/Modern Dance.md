#### Objectives

“Dance is the hidden language of the soul of the body” – Martha Graham

  

The Modern Dance CCA is a great platform for students to pursue their passion in dance, where students are exposed to the various techniques and principles of dance and performance.  At the same time, students demonstrate perseverance as they endure the rigorous dance practices and give their all at every practice or performance. 

  

In their interaction with their peers, they learn to be open-minded as they bond with one another and accept one another’s ideas and differences.
